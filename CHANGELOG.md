### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.545
- Inlay hints for variables will no longer show if the type hint string is the same as the variable name (i.e., `local tbl = {}`, the hint `: tbl` will no longer show) ([#137](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp/issues/137))
- Restructured instance types system to reduce memory and type creation footprint

### Fixed

- Fixed false document diagnostics showing up for opened tabs when VSCode is first started ([#132](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp/issues/132))

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.542

### Fixed

- New service imports which come first alphabetically will group with existing imports rather than going at the beginning of the file
- Fixed warning messages showing up as notifications when generating Rojo Sourcemap even if it works successfully

## [1.9.0] - 2022-08-16

### Added

- Added configuration options to enable certain Language Server features. By default, they are all enabled:

  - `luau-lsp.completion.enabled`: Autocomplete
  - `luau-lsp.hover.enabled`: Hover
  - `luau-lsp.signatureHelp.enabled`: Signature Help

- Added configuration option `luau-lsp.hover.showTableKinds` (default: off) to indicate whether kinds (`{+ ... +}`, `{| ... |}`) are shown in hover information
- Added configuration option `luau-lsp.hover.multilineFunctionDefinitions` (default: off) to spread function definitions in hover panel across multiple lines
- Added configuration option `luau-lsp.hover.strictDatamodelTypes` (default: on) to use strict DataModel type information in hover panel (equivalent to autocomplete). When disabled, the same type information that the diagnostic type checker uses is displayed
- Added support for automatic service importing. When using a service which has not yet been defined, it will be added (alphabetically) to the top of the file. Config setting: `luau-lsp.completion.suggestImports`

### Added

- Added support for cross-file go to definition of functions
- Added support for go-to definition of properties defined on a metatable with `__index`

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.538
- Improved completion detail function param information with better representative types, and include a trailing type pack if present

### Fixed

- Luau LSP will now activate if you run an LSP command
- Fixed finding the incorrect workspace folder to analyze with in a multi-workspace environment

## [1.7.1] - 2022-07-17

### Fixed

- Fix crash when hovering over function type definitions

## [1.7.0] - 2022-07-16

### Added

- Reintroduced support for workspace diagnostics, with proper streaming support. Enable `luau-lsp.diagnostics.workspace` for project wide diagnostics.
- You can now hover over a type node to get type information. In particular, this works for properties inside type tables, and hovering over `typeof()`, allowing you to determine what typeof resolved to.
- Added Go To Definition for type references
- Added `Luau: Regenerate Rojo Sourcemap` command to force regeneration of a Rojo sourcemap
- Improved case where project file `default.project.json` was not found. We search for other project files, and prompt a user to configure

- Document links will now resolve for requires in all locations of a file, not just the top level block

### Fixed

- A diagnostic refresh will now be requested once sourcemap contents change
- With the introduction of workspace diagnostics, ignored files should now only show diagnostics when specifically opened
- Document symbols for method definitions now correctly use a colon instead of a dot operator.
- Fixed crash when hovering over a type node

- Fixed using absolute file paths to point to definition files not working on Windows

## [1.6.0] - 2022-07-02

### Added

- Added `luau-lsp.sourcemap.enabled` option which dictates whether sourcemap-related features are enabled
- Diagnostics will now be provided for definitions files which errored
- Added `luau-lsp.sourcemap.rojoPath` to explicitly specify the path to a Rojo executable instead of relying on it being available from the workspace directory
- Added hover information when hovering over a type definition

### Changed

- Moved definitions file loading to post-initialization
- Sync to upstream Luau 0.534
- A `_` will no longer show when we can't determine a function name / a function isn't named.

### Fixed

- Fixed regression where diagnostics are not cleared when you close an ignored file
- Fixed errors sometimes occuring when you index `script`/`workspace`/`game` for children
- Fixed internal error caused by `:Clone()` calls when called on an expression which isn't an Lvalue (e.g., `inst:FindFirstChild(name):Clone()`)
- Fixed bug where `_: ` would not be removed as the name of function arguments. `function foo(_: number, _: number)` will now show as `function foo(number, number)`
- Fixed analyze mode not exiting with a non-zero exit code when there are errors
- Fixed excessive whitespace in document symbols for expr-named function defintions
- Fixed hover for global functions and local variables

## [1.5.2] - 2022-06-22

### Changed

- Downgraded missing types/documentation files to a warning in the logs instead of a window error. It is common for no file to be provided in a vanilla build.

### Fixed

- Fixed diagnostics not showing for any file after the first one you open

## [1.5.1] - 2022-06-21

### Fixed

- Module name will now be included in hover and signature displays for imported types
- Fixed bug where in-memory contents of a document which was deleted were not cleared, causing spurious errors when recreating a new document of the same name.
- Fixed duplicate diagnostics displayed and never clearing when `workspace` diagnostics configuration was enabled

## [1.5.0] - 2022-06-20

### Added

- Added predicate logic to `EnumItem:IsA("Type")` so it will now narrow the type of an EnumItem when used as a predicate
- Added setting to configure whether all Luau FFlags are enabled by default. This can be configured using `luau-lsp.fflags.enableByDefault` or `--no-flags-enabled` command line option. Currently, all FFlags are enabled by default, but you can manually sync/override them.
- Added support for adding extra definition files to load using `luau-lsp.types.definitionFiles`
- Roblox definitions can now be disabled using `luau-lsp.types.roblox`
- Added label details to completion items

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.532
- Updated to improve table type stringification, with an appropriate newline placed in between braces. This should result in better readable table types when hovering
- Upgraded vscode language client to 8.0, with support for LSP Specification 3.17
- VSCode Client now makes use of diagnostics pull model

### Fixed

- Fixed equality comparison between enum items raising a type error
- Fixed autocompletion of properties with spaces not correctly being converted into a `["property"]` index leading to a type error
- Fixed function stringification when using an expression index call such as `data["property"]()`
- Fixed workspace diagnostics not respecting ignore globs for dependent files

## [1.4.0] - 2022-06-12

### Added

- Added Document Symbols support
- Merged [luau-analyze-rojo](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-analyze-rojo) into the project to simplify maintenance. To run a standalone analysis tool, run `luau-lsp analyze`
- Added links to Luau Documentation for lint warnings
- Added documentation to Enum types
- Diagnostics of dependents (i.e., files which require a changed file) will now refresh to display type errors when the file changes
- Added support for workspace-wide diagnostics to report in all files. You can enable this using `luau-lsp.diagnostics.workspace`. It is disabled by default

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.531
- Unused lints will are now tagged appropriately so they render faded out

### Fixed

- Fixed the equality comparison between two Instance types causing a type error
- Fixed false positive type errors occuring when using DataModel instance types. Unfortunately, for this fix we had to temporarily type all DataModel instances as `any`. You should still get proper autocomplete and intellisense, however type errors will no longer throw for unknown children.
- Fixed enum types to be under the "Enum" library, so the types are referenced using `Enum.Font` instead of `EnumFont`
- HTML Tags have been stripped from documentation so they should render better in IntelliSense
- Fixed "Text Document not loaded locally" error occuring when you start typing in a newly created file (as the sourcemap is not yet up-to-date)

## [1.3.0] - 2022-06-10

### Added

- Added support for configuring enabled Luau FFlags
- Added support for pulling in the currently enabled FFlags in Studio, in order to replicate behaviour

### Changed

- The "Updating API" message will now only show on the status bar instead of a popup notification.
- Instance types will now be named by the Class Name rather than the Instance name
- File system watchers for `.luaurc` and `sourcemap.json` are now registered on the server side

### Fixed

- Fixed requiring modules when using `:FindFirstAncestor("Ancestor")`
- Fixed requiring modules in `LocalPlayer.PlayerGui` / `LocalPlayer.PlayerScripts` / `LocalPlayer.StarterGear`
- Changing `.luaurc` configuration will now refresh the config cache and update internally

## [1.2.0] - 2022-06-04

### Added

- Player will now have `PlayerGui`, `Backpack`, `StarterGear` and `PlayerScripts` children, with the relevant Starter instances copied into it (StarterGui, StarterPack, PlayerScripts)
- `Instance:FindFirstChild("name")` and `Instance:FindFirstAncestor("name")` will now correctly resolve to the relevant instance type if found. This allows the type checker to correctly resolve children/parents etc.

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.530

### Fixed

- Fixed extension repeatedly downloading latest API information when it is already up to date
- Fixed `self: Type` showing up in hover information/autocomplete when it is unnecessary at it has been inferred by the `:` operator
- Fixed extension not displaying error if calling out to `Rojo` command fails
- Fixed reverse dependencies not updating when types of required modules change (causing the type system to be incorrect). i.e., if you required script B in script A, and change script B, now the change will propagate to script A

## [1.1.0] - 2022-05-20

### Added

- Can disable automatic sourcemap generation in extension settings.
- Can change the project file used to generate sourcemap in extension settings (defaults to `default.project.json`).
- Can toggle whether non-script instances are included in the generated sourcemap (included by default).
- Added support for "Find References"
  - Currently only works for finding all references of a local variable in the current document. Cross-file references will come in future.
- Added support for "Rename"
  - Currently only works for local variables in the current document. Cross-file references will come in future.

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.528

## [1.0.0] - 2022-05-19

### Added

- Added hover information for type references
- Added end autocompletion functionality, as done in Studio. Can be enabled through `luau-lsp.autocompleteEnd`
- Added automatic sourcemap regeneration when files change. This relies on `rojo` being available to execute in the workspace folder (i.e., on the PATH), with `rojo sourcemap` command support

### Changed

- Improved Go To Type Definition support
- Improved overall Go To Definition support
  - Can now handle function definitions in tables
  - Can handle cross-file definitions
  - Can handle deeply nested tables - multiple properties (incl. cross file support)
- Hovering over a property inside a table will now give you type information about the assigned expression, rather than just "string"

### Fixed
