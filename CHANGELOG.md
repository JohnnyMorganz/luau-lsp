## [1.32.0] - 2024-07-14

### Added

- Support tilde expansion (`~`) to home directory for definition and documentation file paths
- Added a datamodel-aware `WaitForChild` function

- Fixed crashes where internally we fail to normalise a "virtual path" from a sourcemap to a real path, causing it to mismatch with the filepath understood by VSCode, leading to desync in internal file state. ([#645](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp/issues/645))

## [1.31.1] - 2024-07-07

### Fixed

- The binary on Windows now statically links to the MSVC Runtime to make it more portable ([#657](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp/issues/657))

### Fixed

- Fixed use-after-free when generating sourcemap types

## [1.30.0] - 2024-06-23

- Added option `--platform` to analyze CLI to make configuring `luau-lsp.platform.type` more convenient
- Added support for registering FFlags for the server via initializationOptions, rather than on the command line ([#590](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp/issues/590))
- Added `luau-lsp.inlayHints.makeInsertable` (default: `true`) to configure whether inlay hint type annotations can be inserted by clicking ([#620](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp/issues/620))

- Fixed 'find all references' not working for a global function declared in a file
- Likewise, rename now supports global functions defined in a file ([#568](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp/issues/568))

## [1.29.0] - 2024-05-11

### Added

- Bytecode display will now show type info information. Added setting `luau-lsp.bytecode.typeInfoLevel` (default: 1) to configure the [type info level](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau/blob/259e50903855d1b8be79edc40fc275fd04c9c892/Compiler/include/Luau/Compiler.h#L29-L33) shown.
- Added "magic functions / refinements" support under the New Solver (i.e., special handling of :IsA, :FindFirstChildWhichIsA, :Clone, etc.)

### Changed

- Improved memory usage of document and workspace diagnostics by no longer storing type graphs
- Rewritten the Luau grammar syntax: https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/Luau.tmLanguage

### Fixed

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.615
- Non-function properties will now no longer be shown by default when autocompleting a method call (e.g., `foo:bar`).
  To revert back to the original behaviour, enable `luau-lsp.completion.showPropertiesOnMethodCall`
- Support Ubuntu 20.04

### Fixed

- Gracefully handle filesystem errors when visiting directories for indexing / workspace diagnostics

## [1.27.1] - 2024-01-20

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.609

### Fixed

- Switched to memory-efficient implementation of workspace diagnostics (currently behind FFlag `LuauStacklessTypeClone3`)
- Improved handling of configuration info received from non-VSCode clients
- Functions with explicitly defined `self` parameters are correctly marked with the `method` semantic token

## [1.27.0] - 2023-12-25

### Added

- Autocompletion items for items marked as `@deprecated` via documentation comments will now reflect their deprecated status
- Show string literal byte length and utf8 characters on hover
- Support passing `--settings` to `luau-lsp lsp` configuring the default global settings to use
- Added support for viewing textual bytecode and compiler remarks using commands `Luau: Compute Bytecode for file` and `Luau: Compute Compiler Remarks for file`.
  This opens up a new view with bytecode/remarks inlined as comments in the source file
  - Added configuration `luau-lsp.bytecode.vectorLib`, `luau-lsp.bytecode.vectorCtor` and `luau-lsp.bytecode.vectorType` to configure compiler options when generating bytecode
  - Custom editors should handle the `luau-lsp/bytecode` and `luau-lsp/compilerRemarks` LSP message to integrate compiler remarks info in their editor
- Added `luau-lsp.types.robloxSecurityLevel` to select what security level to use for the API types, out of: `None`, `LocalUserSecurity`, `PluginSecurity` and `RobloxScriptSecurity`

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.607
- Made rename operation fully backed by find all references, to ensure both return results that are consistent with each other
- Hide return type hints for no-op functions
- Changed the VSCode registered language and grammar ID from `lua` to `luau`. **NOTE:
  ** this may affect existing custom themes!
- Renamed `script/globalTypes.d.lua` to `script/globalTypes.d.luau` (the old file will be kept temporarily for compatibility)
- Default security level of API types changed from `RobloxScriptSecurity` to `PluginSecurity` - set `luau-lsp.types.robloxSecurityLevel` to `RobloxScriptSecurity` to see original behaviour
- Improved warning message when Rojo not found when attempting to generate sourcemap, with option to configure settings to disable autogeneration

### Fixed

- Fixed Find All References / Rename not working on a table property defined inline, such as `name` in:

```lua
local T = {
  name = "string"
}
```

- Fixed methods and events showing up in "GetPropertyChangedSignal" autocomplete
- Fixed requiring a directory containing "init.lua" not working
- Fixed go to definition on a property of a table that stores a cross-module type value (e.g. the result of a function defined in another module)

## [1.26.0] - 2023-11-19

### Added

- Added support for documentation comments on table type properties:

```lua
type Foo = {
  --- A documentation comment
  map: () -> ()
}
```

- We now show the file path in the completion description when auto-requiring files

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.604
- Overhauled command line argument parsing system to be more consistent and flexible
- Deprioritized `loadstring` in autocomplete
- `luau-lsp.diagnostics.strictDatamodelTypes` now defaults to `false` on the language server side (note, it was already default `false` in VSCode).
  Defaulting to `true` was unintentional. This will affect external language client users (e.g. neovim)
- Analyze CLI tool now respects `luau-lsp.diagnostics.strictDatamodelTypes` if set in the provided configuration.
  The flag `--no-strict-dm-types` still remains for backwards compatibility reasons, but is now deprecated.

### Fixed

- Attempting to rename a generic type parameter now correctly renames it in all locations
- Fixed renaming a local variable not appropriately renaming any imported types
- Auto-import requires will now show the full codeblock that will be inserted, rather than just the first line if also inserting a service

## [1.25.0] - 2023-10-14

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.599
- Prioritise `game:GetService()` as the first autocompletion entry when typing `game:`
- Code blocks in hover and documentation now use `luau` as the syntax highlighting

### Fixed

- Do not add line separator in hover when there is no text documentation
- Fixed init files not working with directory aliases (e.g. `require("@dir")` or `require("@dir/subdir")`)

## [1.24.1] - 2023-09-09

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.594
- Support autocomplete end on `do` blocks

### Fixed

- Fixed crash when attempting to Go To Definition of an imported type

## [1.24.0] - 2023-08-26

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.592
- Simplified Instance.new and game:GetService calls internally and in the definitions file to reduce complexity issues in the typechecker.

### Fixed

- Fixed cleanup of rojo sourcemap generation process when VSCode exits
- Fixed color presentations values being unclamped causing errors in other editors
- Fixed newline not added to separate services and requires when the suggestion imports both at the same time

## [1.23.0] - 2023-08-06

### Added

- Added command `luau-lsp.reloadServer` to restart the language server without having to reload the workspace

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.589
- Changes to settings which require server restart will now reload the server instead of having to reload the whole VSCode workspace
- Switch to Rojo `rojo sourcemap --watch` command for sourcemap autogeneration. Note that on rojo error, you must manually restart sourcemap regeneration.
  **Requires Rojo v7.3.0+**

### Fixed

- Reverted change to type checking in 1.22.0 that reduced memory footprint. This should resolve the problems where diagnostics aren't showing with an InternalCompilerError, at the cost of increased memory use if `luau-lsp.diagnostics.workspace` is enabled.
- Fixed string require resolution when the string had a secondary extension: `Module.mod` will be resolved as `Module.mod.luau`
- Fixed resolution of directory aliases pointing to relative paths

## [1.22.1] - 2023-07-15

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.584
- Removed need for typechecking for operations that don't require the type information (e.g., document link / color)

### Fixed

- Fixed diagnostics not showing when working in a new file with no workspace open
- Fixed race condition where sometimes the server does not receive user configuration on initial load, falling back to defaults
- `luau-lsp.fflags.override` will now be parsed when using CLI analyze settings. Note that the other `fflags` options are not supported in CLI analyze mode
- Fixed semantic tokens segfault crash on some tables
- Fixed duplicate definitions showing in the Go To Definition page
- Fixed some syntax highlighting inconsistencies
- Added a temporary fix to "RecursionLimitException" exceptions leaking to the public interface.

## [1.22.0] - 2023-06-30

### Added

- Support requiring directories with `init.luau` (or `init.lua`) files inside of them. i.e. `require("../Directory")` resolves to `../Directory/init.luau`.
- The CLI analyze now accepts a parameter `--settings=path/to/settings.json` which takes in LSP-style settings to configure features such as require settings. Note: this is separate to `.luaurc`

#### Changed

- Significant improvements to memory usage in large workspaces when workspace indexing or diagnostics are enabled
- Sync to upstream Luau 0.582
- Deprioritise file or directory aliases over exact paths in autocomplete, since typically aliases start with a prefix (e.g. `@`)
- Signature Help is more intelligent about providing information about the best function overload which matches

### Fixed

- Fixed language features not working in new untitled files
- Fixed incorrect color conversions in the color picker between RGB/HSV/Hex
- Fixed autoimporting modules not respecting multiline requires
- Fixed documentation for `debug` and `utf8` library
- Fixed synthetic `typeof()` showing up in signature help for builtin tables (e.g. `function typeof(string).byte(...)`)
- Fixed signature help highlighting for `string` library
- Fixed rename symbol on a type definition `type NAME = ...`
- Fixed file and directory aliases not being canonicalised to absolute paths causing "Follow Link" to fail when using relative alias paths
- Don't show directory aliases after the first path segment has been typed
- Fixed rename symbol not working when triggered at the end of a symbol
- Fix indentation of autocomplete end when autocompleting inside of a function call

## [1.21.0] - 2023-06-14

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `luau-lsp.autocompleteEnd` setting in favour of `luau-lsp.completion.autocompleteEnd`

### Added

- Added folding ranges for multi-line function definitions, so long parameter lists can be collapsed
- Added notification when we detect definitions file changes
- Added support for auto-requiring modules when autocompleteing a type reference, to allow indexed types: i.e. autocompleting `Module` in `type Foo = Module.Bar`
- Added `luau-lsp.require.directoryAliases` to map require string _prefixes_ to directories
- Added tilde expansion to `luau-lsp.require.fileAliases` (and `directoryAliases`), mapping `~/foo.lua` to a file in your home directory
- End autocompletion will now work for defined anonymous functions inside of function calls

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.580
- Updated workspace indexing strategy to minimise memory usage. We no longer index ignored files (`luau-lsp.ignoreGlobs`),
  and there is a setting `luau-lsp.index.maxFiles` (default: 10,000) to configure the amount of files indexed before backing off.

### Fixed

- When editing in model projects, we now force relative requires, instead of incorrect absolute requires using a "ProjectRoot"

## [1.20.2] - 2023-05-10

### Fixed

- Fixed internal error for LazyType unwrapping

## [1.20.1] - 2023-05-09

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in semantic tokens system causing language server crashes

## [1.20.0] - 2023-05-09

### Added

- Added support for workspace symbols to resolve symbols across the whole workspace. In VSCode, you can open this using `Ctrl + T`
- Added configuration option `luau-lsp.require.fileAliases` to statically provide custom mappings from string requires to a file path.
  For example, adding `@example/constants` mapping to `C:/fakepath/constants.luau` will automatically resolve `require("@example/constants")`
- Added support for Folding Ranges. The language server now signals the following foldable ranges in a document:
  - Whole blocks, such as `do .. end`, `for - do .. end` `function() .. end` etc.
  - Tables, and type tables `x = { .. }`
  - Multiline function calls `foo(..)`
  - Block comments `--[[ .. ]]`
  - Custom comment regions denoted using `--#region` and `--#endregion`
- Added support for Call Hierarchies. Call Hierarchies allow you to view all incoming and outgoing calls of a function:
  i.e., all functions that call the current function, as well as all functions that the current function calls.
  This works at multiple levels, displaying ancestor and descendant functions.

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.575

## [1.19.2]

### Fixed

- Fixed forced expressive types in diagnostics
- Added option `--no-strict-dm-types` for analyze CLI to disable strict datamodel types and its associated false positives

## [1.19.1] - 2023-04-27

### Fixed

- Fixed regression in DataModel item autocompletion

## [1.19.0] - 2023-04-26

### Deprecated

- Deprecated config `luau-lsp.completion.suggestImports`: use `luau-lsp.completion.imports.enabled` instead

### Added

- Added setting `luau-lsp.index.enabled` which will index the whole workspace into memory. If disabled, only limited support for Find All References and rename is possible
- Added support for finding all references of both local and exported types. For exported types, `luau-lsp.index.enabled` must be enabled for full support.
- Added support for renaming table properties across files. If `luau-lsp.index.enabled` is disabled, this feature is disabled for correctness reasons.
- Added support for renaming types (both local and exported). If `luau-lsp.index.enabled` is disabled, this exported types renaming is disabled for correctness reasons.
- Added more settings to auto-importing:
  - `luau-lsp.completion.imports.enabled`: replaces `luau-lsp.completion.suggestImports` (default: false)
  - `luau-lsp.completion.imports.suggestServices`: whether GetService imports are included in suggestions (default: true)
  - `luau-lsp.completion.imports.suggestRequires`: whether auto-requires are included in suggestions (default: true)
  - `luau-lsp.completion.imports.requireStyle`: the style of require format (default: "auto")
  - `luau-lsp.completion.imports.separateGroupsWithLine`: whether an empty line should be added in between services and requires (default: false)

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.573
- Improved find all references system for tables. We can now track all references to table and its properties across files. This requires `luau-lsp.index.enabled` to be enabled for full support.

### Fixed

- Fixed pull diagnostics result not following spec
- Fixed errors when file has shebang `#!` present at top of file
- Fixed string require autocompletion failing when autocomplete triggered on an incomplete string, e.g. `require("Constants/Te|")`.
  Originally, nothing would autocomplete. Now, everything inside of the Constants folder will still autocomplete as usual (filtered for "Te").

## [1.18.1] - 2023-03-23

### Fixed

- Fixed server crash when auto require imports is enabled and there is a type-asserted require present in the file (`require(location) :: any`)
- Fixed additional automatic service imports when completing an automatic require import being placed before a hot comment (such as `--!strict`)
- Fixed automatic require import being placed incorrectly we also autocomplete a service. This can be shown when there is a multiline comment, and the service is imported above that comment, but the require gets imported inside of the comment incorrectly.

## [1.18.0] - 2023-03-20

### Added

- Added support for changing `Color3` colors using the color picker
- Added support for automatic require imports (currently only for Roblox mode). If you start typing the name of a module in your code, you can autocomplete the require statement automatically. This feature is enabled by setting `luau-lsp.completion.suggestImports`.

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.568.
  In particular, this provide improvements to control flow analysis refinements. This allows the type checker to recognise type
  options that are unreachable after a conditional/unconditional code block. e.g.:

```lua
local function x(x: string?)
    if not x then return end

    -- x is 'string' here
end
```

To enable this feature, the FFlag `LuauTinyControlFlowAnalysis` must currently be enabled.

- The language server will only be enabled on "file" and "untitled" schemes. This means it will be disabled in diff mode
  and live share. This is because we cannot yet provide sufficient information in these contexts.

## [1.17.1] - 2023-03-04

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.566

### Fixed

- Don't autocomplete another set of parentheses on a function call if they already exist
- Fix `.luaurc` in current working directory not taken into account when calling `luau-lsp analyze`

## [1.17.0] - 2023-02-12

### Added

- Added two code actions: `Sort requires` and `Sort services` (services only enabled if `luau-lsp.types.roblox` == true).
  These actions will sort their respective groups alphabetically based on a variable name set.
  You can also set these actions to automatically run on save by configuring:

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
"source.organizeImports": true
}
```

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.563
- Prioritised common services and Instance properties/methods in autocomplete so that they show up first

### Fixed

- Further fixes to document symbols failing due to malformed ranges

## [1.16.4] - 2023-02-10

### Fixed

- Fixed document symbols crashing due to internal malformed data

## [1.16.3] - 2023-02-09

### Fixed

- Changed internal representation of documents to reduce the likelihood of Request Failed for "No managed text document"

## [1.16.2] - 2023-02-01

### Fixed

- Fixed document symbol crash on incomplete functions
- Fixed `--base-luaurc` not registering for an LSP server
- Fixed crashing on invalid FFlags configuration - the VSCode client will now validate the flags

## [1.16.1] - 2023-01-30

### Fixed

- Fixed error in document symbols not conforming to specification - `selectionRange` will now be fully enclosed by `range`

## [1.16.0] - 2023-01-29

### Added

- Support documentation comments attached to a table and table types, e.g. on `DATA` in the followign:

```lua
--- Doc comment
local DATA = {
    ...
}

--- Doc comment
type Contents = {
	...
}
```

- Include documentation comments on functions and tables in autocompletion
- Added configuration option `luau-lsp.require.mode` to configure how string requires are resolved. It can either be `relativeToWorkspaceRoot` (default) or `relativeToFile`
- Added `luau-lsp.types.documentationFiles` to support adding extra documentation symbols to the database. These are used to support definition files, and should be in the same format as [shown here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Client-Tracker/roblox/api-docs/en-us.json)
- Added `luau-lsp.diagnostics.strictDatamodelTypes` (default: `false`) which configures whether we use expressive DataModel types to power diagnostics.
  When off, `game` / `script` / `workspace` (and all their members) are typed as `any`, which helps to prevent false positives, but may lead to false negatives.
- Added CLI option `--base-luaurc=PATH` for both LSP and Analyze mode to provide a path to a `.luaurc` file which is used as the default configuration
- Added support for Go To Definition / Type Definition on imported type references `module.Type` (gated behind FFlag `SupportTypeAliasGoToDeclaration`)

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.560
- Class symbols with no documentation present in the docs file will no longer show anything on hover/autocomplete (i.e. won't show `@luau/global/require`)
- `Instance.new()` now excepts variables which are of type string without erroring. It will instead error when Instance.new is called with a string literal which is an unknown class name
- In the CLI, `luau-lsp lsp` now supports passing multiple `--docs=` parameters
- The CLI will now error when an unknown option is passed to it
- Diagnostics will now be emitted on `.luaurc` files with parse errors

### Fixed

- Fixed unknown require errors occurring in multi-root workspaces when in a folder which isn't the first one
- Fixed diagnostics not clearing for files which were deleted unconventionally (i.e., outside of VSCode using File Explorer, or external commands such as `git stash`)

## [1.15.0] - 2023-01-11

### Added

- Added syntax highlighting support for interpolated strings
- Added color viewers for Color3.new/fromRGB/fromHSV/fromHex
- Added support for autocompleting require-by-string functions with files and folders
- Support documentation comments on variables:

```lua
--- documentation comment
local x = "string"

--- another doc comment
local y = function()
end
```

- Support documentation comments on table properties, such as the following:

```lua
local tbl = {
    --- This is some special information
    data = "hello",
    --- This is a doc comment
    values = function()
    end,
}

local x = tbl.values -- Should give "This is a doc comment"
local y = tbl.data -- Should give "This is some special information"
```

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.558
- All Luau FFlags are no longer enabled by default. This can be re-enabled by configuring `luau-lsp.fflags.enableByDefault`. It is recommended to keep `luau-lsp.fflags.sync` enabled so that FFlags sync with upstream Luau
- Allow variable number of `=` sign for multiline doc comments, so `--[[` and `--[===[` etc. are valid openers

### Fixed

- Luau analyze now exits with code 0 if there are no reported errors (all errors are ignored)
- `require(instance:FindFirstChild("Testing", true))` will no longer resolve as an immediate child of instance due to the recursive argument

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.531
- Unused lints will are now tagged appropriately so they render faded out

### Fixed

- Fixed the equality comparison between two Instance types causing a type error

- Fixed enum types to be under the "Enum" library, so the types are referenced using `Enum.Font` instead of `EnumFont`
- HTML Tags have been stripped from documentation so they should render better in IntelliSense
- Fixed "Text Document not loaded locally" error occuring when you start typing in a newly created file (as the sourcemap is not yet up-to-date)

- `Instance:FindFirstChild("name")` and `Instance:FindFirstAncestor("name")` will now correctly resolve to the relevant instance type if found. This allows the type checker to correctly resolve children/parents etc.

### Changed

- Sync to upstream Luau 0.530

### Fixed

- Improved Go To Type Definition support
- Improved overall Go To Definition support
  - Can now handle function definitions in tables
  - Can handle cross-file definitions
